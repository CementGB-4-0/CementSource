# CementGB

> CementGB is currently in a pre-release WIP state. Join the modding discord for consistent updates on progress as well as support.

Formerly the Cement mod loader, CementGB is now a general-purpose modding API for Gang Beasts, loaded by MelonLoader. It allows mod makers to inject their own maps, costumes (WIP), and other assets into the game, and provides boilerplate to speed code mod development up a ton.

Documentation pending.
