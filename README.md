CementGB, or simply Cement, is a general-purpose modding API for Gang Beasts. It enables mod creators to get their mods done quicker and better, as well as adding a ton of capability for easy user-generated content, such as custom maps and costumes when used in conjunction with the [GBMDK Unity project](https://github.com/CementGB-4-0/GBMDK) (WIP), among some other nifty features.  


CementGB is powered by [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/) and its dependencies. It can be downloaded on the [Gang Beasts Thunderstore page](https://thunderstore.io/c/gang-beasts/p/CementGB/CementGB/), the [official website](https://cementgb-4-0.github.io/CementGB.github.io/), or the [Releases section](https://github.com/CementGB-4-0/CementSource/releases) of the GitHub repository.

> [!NOTE]
> CementGB's source code can now also be found (mirrored) on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/CementGB/CementSource), for people who are unable to access GitHub. Keep in mind that this is a mirror from GitHub and may be significantly delayed in updates.
